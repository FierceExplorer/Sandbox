TPT 0.1   
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
   * Benefits : acces to almost all the knowledge of the world with the internet, worldwide connections to other people all around the world, allows humans to do things that are almost impossible by hand such as massive algebraic equations or creating simulatiosn 
   * Harmful : The invention of better cameras and more access to everything can lead to more invasions of privacy, can lead to higher levels of depression due to the fact that you spend a lot of time seeing how other people live their lives, less incentivied to go outside. 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
   * I think dopamine issues are a real thing and that there truly can be problems with how people get their dopamine especially when it becomes addictive and affects their life. However, I feel it is unfair to just say video games shouldn't be used as dopamine since everyone get's their dopamine in different ways. The only real thing impacting my studies right now is trying to balance everything in my life right now.     


TPT 0.2   
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
   * Someone can empower themselves in the digital world by gaing access to tons of different things on the internet. They can access to tons of email accounts and gain access to tons of information every where. They have to power to contact people from anywhere in the world and they can gain access to other posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more. 
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
   * Someone that is empowered is able to help someone that is not empowered by cooperating with them and helping them with their needs. Because they are not empowered, they may not have the same access to information and communication and so someone that is empowered can use their abilities to help the people who are not. Something that I could at Del Norte HS is to help people with their coding especially in my AP CSP class. If someone needs help with their homework or needs help with someone, I can use my access to the Internet to help them. 
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
   * There is a lot of red tape blocking digital empowerment in other parts of the world. This appears a lot in China and North Korea where internet access is always monitered and limited. In places like those, the internet is always being watched and so internet access is limited. There doesn't seem to be such barriers at Del Norte. All students have access to chromebooks and computers that they can use and the wifi is free.

TPT 1.0   
The owner of the computer clearly finds the bug a joke. They are laughing at the way that it works and is making a funny video out of it. I think this happened because the creators did not do enough testing on the program. The program didn't recognize him as a person because of his skin color and must see him as a background and therefore won't track his face. This should obviously definitely be corrected because if it wasn't then the computer would have heavy bias against a certain race which would not stand by in this time. I think this ended up happening because there was not enough testing done. Either the creators of the program didn't test a wide enough variety of races or they never tested the program in a darker enviroment.     

TPT 1.1      
One crowdsourcing idea could be implemented for the 150 Computer Science students is a sort of review system that could be made for our website. Our website will be about AP classes and so if there was a sort of review system then the AP computer science students coulld leave a review on the class. This idea could in fact expand to every student at Del Norte. The students could leave reviews on each AP class that they have taken. In fact, we could make each page a Wikipedia-esque sort of page where the user could edit the page if they wanted to. That way the information on the page could be crowdsourced and created directly from kids who are in the AP classes.    
# Week 2 
TPT 2.0    
Many different types of licenses all of which allows the user to do different things with the software. 
##### MIT Liscense  
Allows user to edit the software, use it for commercial use, and to disttribute it to other people. However, if you were to use this license that means that the creator of the code is not responsible for fixing the code if you break it and is not responsible for any harm that the code may cause.     
##### GPL 
Allows many of the same permissions as the MIT license but they also allow patent use. That means that the all contributors must express patent rights. In addition to this additional requirement, there are some additional conditions that are applied. Some of these conditions are that the source code must be made available when the licensed material is distributed, modifications to the software must be recorded and that the same license must apply to the modifications as the original code. 
##### Mozilla Public License 
This does very similar things to the GPL licenses but there are some slight but very major changes. The Mozilla Public License states that modification to existing files must have the same license. This means that if the licensed work is being used in a larger piece of work, the source code doesn't have to be distributed and the terms can be changed. There is also an additional limitation to this license. That is the trademark license that states that it does not grant trademark rights. 
#### Safe Computing 
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
   * PII that I have seen on projects in CompSci Principles are in the AboutMe pages put in the websites. These about me pages usually had information about us as a person. It could have pictures of us and our names. Some people put their email adresses or maybe their birthdate. Nothing too serious was put in projects for CompSci Principles which is good.   
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
   * I feel that there are some PII which is okay to expose to te public and the world and some PII must be kept personal at almost all costs. I think that everyone has PII and that it is important to keep what need's to be safe, safe. For example, stuff like your name. your birthdate, what school you got to and what you may look like are all information that is almost completely public. Other information such as your social sercurity number, your tax records, and maybe credentials or two-factor credentials are absolutely necessary to keep silent because if this information is leaked out, you can get your identity stolen. 
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
   * Good passwords are passwords that are long, convoluted, and have a mixture of characters, letters and numbers to make it hard to guess. Bad passwords are easy to guess and can easily be bruteforced which makes the system very very unsafe. Usually good passwords are at least 8 letters long, has both lowercase and uppercase letters, characters, and numbers. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is two-factor authentication. That means that there are actually two keys that are needed to authenticate something such as a password and a biometric scan. Maybe there are two different passwords that must be used. 
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
   * Symmetric encryption is where one key is used to both encrypt the information and decrypt the information. This means that this key must be kept very safe or else it can used for both encrypting and decrypting. An assymmetric encryption is an encryption where there are two keys that are used for descrypting and encrypting. A public key is used for encrypting the information while a private key is used for decrypting the information. 
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
   * An example of encryption we used in deployment is on the software to update the deployed website. The software that is being used to update the delopyed webiste requires a password to enter. That means that there is encryption since a password is being used to protect data. 
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
   * I have never actually fell for a phishing scheme. I've never had my information stolen or anything like that which I feel very lucky about. Although I have never learened about phushing schemes the hard way, I understand what they can look like and what they so I can avoid falling for them. I know that generally phishing attempts will include asking for very personal information generally through an email. The phishing attempt might claim to be the bank or something that is really important in order to try to trick you into clicking and giving the information needed.
