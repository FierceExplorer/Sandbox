**5.3 Computing Bias Video One**

Explicit Data     
* data that you are giving to it    
 
Implicit Data    
* data that is collected from data streams and not intentionally given    

Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.     
Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.     
Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.    
All software can be biased whether unintentional or intentional     

Questions to ask about bias :     
* enhancing or intentionally excluding? 
* intentionally harmful/hateful
* receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?
