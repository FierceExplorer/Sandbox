# Create Task Project for Website 
Idea: The program accepts a list of numbers and then you can tell it what you want to do with the list out of the given options. The way the program works is that it will ask the user for a list of numbers. Then it will display a menu with different functions such as the average of all numbers, the sum of all numbers, the biggest number, the smallest number and etc.  
* Input: The user has to input a list which the program can use later
* Use of list/collection type: My program will be using a list which is the user input, and the program will also be using a the values inside the list which are integers 
* Procedure: My program will use a variety of different programs on the inputted list. Different functions will need to be made and used on the inputted list. 
* Algorithm: My program will be using a lot of loops. I essentially have two user inputted areas. One is for the list itself and the other is what the list is going to do. It is going to use a lot of if else loops, to do determine which functions the list should be used on and the functions themselves could also be handmade. 
* Calls: The calls will just be the user submitting the list and what function to use. 
* Output: The output will be completely text and numbers.

This is the result of the Create Task Project. **This is not complete**  

| Requirements | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Input | User inputs any size list first.  |
| Use of list/collection type | The functions all use the user inputted list. The menu itself is actually using an array. The menu uses 2D array that contains both the functions that is displayed and the file used  |
| Procedure | Every single time the user inputs a number, it corresponds to a specific file which is then executed. In each file is a function that does what the number says it does |
| Algorithm | Uses a lot of sequencing specifically when creating the menu. The code is run sequentially and whenever input is given, it reruns everything again. | 
| Calls | The functions run in each file are called to actually work. | 
| Output | The output is just completely text and numbers |
## Create Task Project for AP Exam 
I have an alternate idea for the AP Exam that I feel is a better show of my abilities. It is a reflex tester. There will be 5 buttons. 3 will randomly change colors when you start and a timer will start. Once all three buttons are clicked, the timer is ended and it displays your time. 
This is a test of my CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It is input because the user is playing the game. There are procedures because I am going to create procedures for starting the timer, changing the button colors and more. The output is the game itself as well.
