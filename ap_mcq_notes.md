Question 23 - Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy?     

I had chosen the answer D which said "The user’s public key used for encryption". However, Collegboard says the answer is A which states "A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser" This makes a lot of sense because even though finding a user's key used for encryption would be privacy breaking, this states specifically the public key. By nature, the public key is already public so it doesn't compromise the user's privacy. With a cookies, a hacker could take the cookies and figure out which sites the user might use and easily collect information on the user.     

Question 24 - Which of the following best explains how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet?  

The answer that I had chosen is that the data in the packets are encrypted and the metadata that is sent has the key to decrypt the data. However, the correct answer was that data needs to be transmitted without being encrypted. After some research, I have learned that not all data and packets need to be encrypted and so that means my answer was incorrect.     

Question 28 -  Which of the following is a true statement about data compression?    

For this question, I had chosen that by compressing files, the file and data could not be intercepted. However, this is not true and data can still be intercepted even if the data and file is compressed. The correct answer was that there are always benefits and drawbacks to compressing files. This is clear through lossy compression where data is compressed and then returned back to normal. However, the problem with this compression is that it is possible for data to be lost. This is a drawback.  

Question 44 - Which of the following is LEAST likely to indicate a phishing attack?    

For this question, I had misread the answers and didn't understand it fully. The correct was that the bank asks you to call the number on the back of the card to verify a transaction. I didn't understand this when I first read it and didn't realize it meant the bank's phone number. Because it's the bank's phone number, that is public and therefore if you call the number and follow the instructions, it's a very very high likelyhood that this is not a phishing attack.

Which of the following best describes the behavior of the code segment?     

For this question, I had misread the question and didn't understand the code properly. I had assumed that since it was multiplying 5 three times, it was (5 * 3). However, this is obviously 5^3 and so that's why the answer is 2(5^3).
