Question 23 - Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy?     

I had chosen the answer D which said "The user’s public key used for encryption". However, Collegboard says the answer is A which states "A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser" This makes a lot of sense because even though finding a user's key used for encryption would be privacy breaking, this states specifically the public key. By nature, the public key is already public so it doesn't compromise the user's privacy. With a cookies, a hacker could take the cookies and figure out which sites the user might use and easily collect information on the user.     

Question 24 - Which of the following best explains how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet?  

The answer that I had chosen is that the data in the packets are encrypted and the metadata that is sent has the key to decrypt the data. However, the correct answer was that data needs to be transmitted without being encrypted. After some research, I have learned that not all data and packets need to be encrypted and so that means my answer was incorrect.     

Question 28 -  Which of the following is a true statement about data compression?    

For this question, I had chosen that by compressing files, the file and data could not be intercepted. However, this is not true and data can still be intercepted even if the data and file is compressed. The correct answer was that there are always benefits and drawbacks to compressing files. This is clear through lossy compression where data is compressed and then returned back to normal. However, the problem with this compression is that it is possible for data to be lost. This is a drawback.  

Question 44 - Which of the following is LEAST likely to indicate a phishing attack?    

For this question, I had misread the answers and didn't understand it fully. The correct was that the bank asks you to call the number on the back of the card to verify a transaction. I didn't understand this when I first read it and didn't realize it meant the bank's phone number. Because it's the bank's phone number, that is public and therefore if you call the number and follow the instructions, it's a very very high likelyhood that this is not a phishing attack.

Which of the following best describes the behavior of the code segment?     

For this question, I had misread the question and didn't understand the code properly. I had assumed that since it was multiplying 5 three times, it was (5 * 3). However, this is obviously 5^3 and so that's why the answer is 2(5^3).

Question 2 - Which of the following best explains the ability to solve problems algorithmically?      

This question asks whether or not a problem can be solved algorithmically. I assumed that any problem can be solved algorithmically but instead not every problem. These problems are called undecidable problems.     

Question 6 - Which of the following algorithms display all integers between 1 and 20, inclusive, that are not divisible by 3 ?     
Select two answers.      

I misread this problem. Out of the two options that I had to choose, I had got one of the answers correct. However, I misread the code of the other problem and thought that it displayed all the values that were not divisible by 3. However, it in fact does and so I got that question wrong.   

Question 8 - A teacher has a goal of displaying the names of 2 students selected at random from a group of 30 students in a classroom. Any possible pair of students should be equally likely to be selected. Which of the following algorithms can be used to accomplish the teacher’s goal?   

Again, I misread the question and didn't realize what the question was asking. I didn't realize that the same student couldn't be picked twice. Because of this, I chose the option that had a possibility of choosung the same student twice. It didn't remove the student from the list of possible students to pick which is why it's wrong.       

Question 23 - Which of the following hypotheses is most consistent with the data in the table?

For this question, it asked for a trend in the table given to us. I had stated that the number of daily messages sent per user has not changed but the correct answer was that the length of texts got shortes since the release of the mobile app. Although both are true, the trend in the length of texts is more supported by the data so that is the correct answer. 

Question 20 - Consider the following numeric values.      
    
* Binary 1011   
* Binary 1101  
* Decimal 5   
* Decimal 12  
Which of the following lists the values in order from least to greatest?   

I had figured out the values. I was just not thinking clearly and did the problem too fast so I messed it up. 1011 in decimal is 11 while 1101 is 13. Therefore the order should be Decimal 5 -> Binary 1011 -> Decimal 12 -> Binary 1101.
