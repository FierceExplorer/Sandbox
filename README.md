1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
   * Benefits : acces to almost all the knowledge of the world with the internet, worldwide connections to other people all around the world, allows humans to do things that are almost impossible by hand such as massive algebraic equations or creating simulatiosn 
   * Harmful : The invention of better cameras and more access to everything can lead to more invasions of privacy, can lead to higher levels of depression due to the fact that you spend a lot of time seeing how other people live their lives, less incentivied to go outside. 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
   * I think dopamine issues are a real thing and that there truly can be problems with how people get their dopamine especially when it becomes addictive and affects their life. However, I feel it is unfair to just say video games shouldn't be used as dopamine since everyone get's their dopamine in different ways. The only real thing impacting my studies right now is trying to balance everything in my life right now.
