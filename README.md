1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
   * Benefits : acces to almost all the knowledge of the world with the internet, worldwide connections to other people all around the world, allows humans to do things that are almost impossible by hand such as massive algebraic equations or creating simulatiosn 
   * Harmful : The invention of better cameras and more access to everything can lead to more invasions of privacy, can lead to higher levels of depression due to the fact that you spend a lot of time seeing how other people live their lives, less incentivied to go outside. 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
   * I think dopamine issues are a real thing and that there truly can be problems with how people get their dopamine especially when it becomes addictive and affects their life. However, I feel it is unfair to just say video games shouldn't be used as dopamine since everyone get's their dopamine in different ways. The only real thing impacting my studies right now is trying to balance everything in my life right now.     


TPT 0.2   
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
   * Someone can empower themselves in the digital world by gaing access to tons of different things on the internet. They can access to tons of email accounts and gain access to tons of information every where. They have to power to contact people from anywhere in the world and they can gain access to other posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more. 
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
   * Someone that is empowered is able to help someone that is not empowered by cooperating with them and helping them with their needs. Because they are not empowered, they may not have the same access to information and communication and so someone that is empowered can use their abilities to help the people who are not. Something that I could at Del Norte HS is to help people with their coding especially in my AP CSP class. If someone needs help with their homework or needs help with someone, I can use my access to the Internet to help them. 
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
   * There is a lot of red tape blocking digital empowerment in other parts of the world. This appears a lot in China and North Korea where internet access is always monitered and limited. In places like those, the internet is always being watched and so internet access is limited. There doesn't seem to be such barriers at Del Norte. All students have access to chromebooks and computers that they can use and the wifi is free.

TPT 1.0   
The owner of the computer clearly finds the bug a joke. They are laughing at the way that it works and is making a funny video out of it. I think this happened because the creators did not do enough testing on the program. The program didn't recognize him as a person because of his skin color and must see him as a background and therefore won't track his face. This should obviously definitely be corrected because if it wasn't then the computer would have heavy bias against a certain race which would not stand by in this time. I think this ended up happening because there was not enough testing done. Either the creators of the program didn't test a wide enough variety of races or they never tested the program in a darker enviroment.     

TPT 1.1      
One crowdsourcing idea could be implemented for the 150 Computer Science students is a sort of review system that could be made for our website. Our website will be about AP classes and so if there was a sort of review system then the AP computer science students coulld leave a review on the class. This idea could in fact expand to every student at Del Norte. The students could leave reviews on each AP class that they have taken. In fact, we could make each page a Wikipedia-esque sort of page where the user could edit the page if they wanted to. That way the information on the page could be crowdsourced and created directly from kids who are in the AP classes.
