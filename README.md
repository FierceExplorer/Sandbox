TPT 0.1   
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
   * Benefits : acces to almost all the knowledge of the world with the internet, worldwide connections to other people all around the world, allows humans to do things that are almost impossible by hand such as massive algebraic equations or creating simulatiosn 
   * Harmful : The invention of better cameras and more access to everything can lead to more invasions of privacy, can lead to higher levels of depression due to the fact that you spend a lot of time seeing how other people live their lives, less incentivied to go outside. 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
   * I think dopamine issues are a real thing and that there truly can be problems with how people get their dopamine especially when it becomes addictive and affects their life. However, I feel it is unfair to just say video games shouldn't be used as dopamine since everyone get's their dopamine in different ways. The only real thing impacting my studies right now is trying to balance everything in my life right now.     


TPT 0.2 
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
   * Someone can empower themselves in the digital world by gaing access to tons of different things on the internet. They can access to tons of email accounts and gain access to tons of information every where. They have to power to contact people from anywhere in the world and they can gain access to other posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more. 
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
   * Someone that is empowered is able to help someone that is not empowered by cooperating with them and helping them with their needs. Because they are not empowered, they may not have the same access to information and communication and so someone that is empowered can use their abilities to help the people who are not. Something that I could at Del Norte HS is to help people with their coding especially in my AP CSP class. If someone needs help with their homework or needs help with someone, I can use my access to the Internet to help them. 
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
   * There is a lot of red tape blocking digital empowerment in other parts of the world. This appears a lot in China and North Korea where internet access is always monitered and limited. In places like those, the internet is always being watched and so internet access is limited. There doesn't seem to be such barriers at Del Norte. All students have access to chromebooks and computers that they can use and the wifi is free.
