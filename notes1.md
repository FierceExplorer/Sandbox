Beneficial and Harmful effects of Technology    
Accelerometers     
- automobile industry drove price down    
    - used in airbag deployment and lateral movement detection     
   
The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations     
Examples of Pros and Cons of Innovation    
Multirotor     
- Pros: delivery, finding lost people, aerial photography is easy    
- Cons: privacy concerns, flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous   
 
Wii Controller    
* Benefit - gets people active playing video games    
* Harmful - Broken TV's and injuries    

Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.    
A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person    

3D Printers    
- Open-source software for the computer and printer    
- In schools and homes     
People create computing innovations.    
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields   
All things have a beneficial and harmful effect.

The Internet     
- Benefit - dopamine feedback loops     
- Harmful - dopamine feedback loops, sleep deprivation, anxiety, impulsivity     

Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended    
Responsible programmers try to consider their unintended ways their competing innovations can be used.    
It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.    
Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.     

**5.2 Digital Divide Video One   ** 

Digital Divide    
- refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics   
- Socioeconomic - how much money comes into the household per year    
     - Do you have enough disposable income to get devices? Can you pay for high-speed internet?    
- Geographic - depending on where you are, there may be more internet access or less    
- Demographics include but not isolated to age or religion and more.    
In some countries    
- computers are not that common in rural areas    
- only a small number of websites    
- the internet is used to protect and advocate the government    
- there is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government   
The Digital Divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally.
